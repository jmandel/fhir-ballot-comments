## Unbounded time period definitions are unclear

Regarding the processing of unbounded time periods:

> the boundaries are implicitly considered above or below calculable time

This language is unclear.  It would be better to say something like
"Implicitly, a missing lower boundary acts like -Infinity (that is,  a period
with no lower boundary is 'less than' any actual date).  A missing upper
boundary acts like +Infinity (that is, a period with no upper boundary is
'greater than' any actual date)."
