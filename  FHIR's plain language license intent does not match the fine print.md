## FHIR's plain language license intent does not match the fine print

In `1.2.3`, FHIR's plain language licence intent states that 

> You can create derivative specifications or implementation-related products
> and services

Whereas the "fine print" stipulates that

> no modifications are made to this specification.

So, while I'd imagine the plain language intent lets me define (say) a SMART
Resources specification based on (modified from) FHIR definitions`, the fine
print appears to forbid it.
