## Documentation needs a clear way to separte code from text`

The FHIR documentation needs a consistent way to separate parameters (code)
from text.  Right now bolding, quotation, and capital letters are used in different 
places; sometimes there is nothing offsetting code from the surrounding text.  

A much clearer approach would be to use a fixed-width font with offsetting
background color, just [the way that Bootstrap renders `<code>`
tags](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#code)
