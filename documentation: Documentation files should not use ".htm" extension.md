## Documentation files should not use ".htm" extension

A purely stylistic point (and, as such, a matter of personal taste): FHIR's official
documentation URLs should not expose ".htm" extensions. ".html" would be better
(more in line with common practice), or I would advocate for extension-less
URLs.
